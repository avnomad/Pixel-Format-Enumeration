PFD_DRAW_TO_WINDOW	The buffer can draw to a window or device surface.
PFD_DRAW_TO_BITMAP	The buffer can draw to a memory bitmap.
PFD_SUPPORT_GDI	The buffer supports GDI drawing. This flag and PFD_DOUBLEBUFFER are mutually exclusive in the current generic implementation.
PFD_SUPPORT_OPENGL	The buffer supports OpenGL drawing.
PFD_GENERIC_ACCELERATED	The pixel format is supported by a device driver that accelerates the generic implementation. If this flag is clear and the PFD_GENERIC_FORMAT flag is set, the pixel format is supported by the generic implementation only.
PFD_GENERIC_FORMAT	The pixel format is supported by the GDI software implementation, which is also known as the generic implementation. If this bit is clear, the pixel format is supported by a device driver or hardware.
PFD_NEED_PALETTE	The buffer uses RGBA pixels on a palette-managed device. A logical palette is required to achieve the best results for this pixel type. Colors in the palette should be specified according to the values of the cRedBits, cRedShift, cGreenBits, cGreenShift, cBluebits, and cBlueShift members. The palette should be created and realized in the device context before calling wglMakeCurrent.
PFD_NEED_SYSTEM_PALETTE	Defined in the pixel format descriptors of hardware that supports one hardware palette in 256-color mode only. For such systems to use hardware acceleration, the hardware palette must be in a fixed order (for example, 3-3-2) when in RGBA mode or must match the logical palette when in color-index mode.
PFD_DOUBLEBUFFER	The buffer is double-buffered. This flag and PFD_SUPPORT_GDI are mutually exclusive in the current generic implementation.
PFD_STEREO	The buffer is stereoscopic. This flag is not supported in the current generic implementation.
PFD_SWAP_LAYER_BUFFERS	Indicates whether a device can swap individual layer planes with pixel formats that include double-buffered overlay or underlay planes. Otherwise all layer planes are swapped together as a group. When this flag is set, wglSwapLayerBuffers is supported.
PFD_DEPTH_DONTCARE	The requested pixel format can either have or not have a depth buffer. To select a pixel format without a depth buffer, you must specify this flag. The requested pixel format can be with or without a depth buffer. Otherwise, only pixel formats with a depth buffer are considered.
PFD_DOUBLEBUFFER_DONTCARE	The requested pixel format can be either single- or double-buffered.
PFD_STEREO_DONTCARE	The requested pixel format can be either monoscopic or stereoscopic.
PFD_SWAP_COPY	Specifies the content of the back buffer in the double-buffered main color plane following a buffer swap. Swapping the color buffers causes the content of the back buffer to be copied to the front buffer. The content of the back buffer is not affected by the swap. PFD_SWAP_COPY is a hint only and might not be provided by a driver.
PFD_SWAP_EXCHANGE	Specifies the content of the back buffer in the double-buffered main color plane following a buffer swap. Swapping the color buffers causes the exchange of the back buffer's content with the front buffer's content. Following the swap, the back buffer's content contains the front buffer's content before the swap. PFD_SWAP_EXCHANGE is a hint only and might not be provided by a driver.
PFD_TYPE_RGBA	RGBA pixels. Each pixel has four components in this order: red, green, blue, and alpha.
PFD_TYPE_COLORINDEX	Color-index pixels. Each pixel uses a color-index value.
